## Discrete Math & Combinatorics

counting underlies developments in arithmetic, geometry algebra

onto function - range is exhausted by input
one to one - each input corresponds to a unique output, or:
"whenever x is different from y, f(x) is different from f(y)"


The number of functions from a set X to another set Y is given by |Y||X| since each element in the set X has |Y| choices.
Every subset of A×B is a binary relation and A×B has mn elements hence 2mn subsets.

where order doesn't matter, you have to take all possible permutations and get rid of duplicates

example: ways you can get a hand of 5 cards

52 unique cards

5 spots: _ _ _ _ _

number of possible hands (permutations, aka order matters) = 52 * 51 * 50 * 49 * 48

that can be written as

52!
-------
(52-5)!

which is

52!
-----
47!

and this basically gives you the top 5 terms of 52! factorial.

This still hasn't erased the duplicates, though.

For the cards we do have, we need to find the number of ways they can be re-arranged and put this in the divisor of the fraction above

number of ways a hand can be re-arranged: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

so in the end we have:

52!
----
5!(52-5)!                            

or

52!
-----
5!(47)!

CONCLUSION:

C(n,k), n choose k, where order doesn't matter AND you can't repeat n:

n!
-----
k!(n-k)!
