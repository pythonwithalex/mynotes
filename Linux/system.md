enable and disable peripherals

peripherals like keyboards, external USB drives, etc communicate with the CPU in the form of interruptions delivered through an I/O port.

Alternately, today there is DMA for devices which require a lot of data (high I/O overhead) which allocates a section in RAM for direct, port-less, I/O channel-less access.

configure systems with or without the external peripherals like a keyboard
